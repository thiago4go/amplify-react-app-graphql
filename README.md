## Overview

In this tutorial, you will create a simple full-stack web application using AWS Amplify, a set of tools and services including a web hosting service. In the first module, you will build and host a React application on AWS. Through the remaining four modules, you will initialize a local app using the CLI, add authentication, add a GraphQL API and database, and update your app to store images.

### What you will accomplish

This tutorial will walk you through the steps to create a simple web application discussed above. You will learn:
Hosting: Build and host a React application on the AWS global content delivery network (CDN)
Authentication: Add auth to your app to activate sign-in and sign-out
Database and storage: Add a GraphQL API, database, and storage solution

### Conclusion

You have deployed a web application using AWS Amplify! You have added authentication to your app allowing users to sign up, sign in, and manage their account. The app also has a scalable GraphQL API configured with an Amazon DynamoDB database, allowing users to create and delete notes. You have also added file storage using Amazon S3 so that users can upload images and view them in their app.
